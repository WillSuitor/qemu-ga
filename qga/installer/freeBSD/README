To install, run the install_qga script as root from the freeBSD directory then reboot.

!!!MAKE SURE TO CHECK THE STATUS OF THE SERVICE!!!
You might be missing dependencies (most likely glib 2.56). Running the qemu-ga executable (located at /usr/local/bin/qemu-ga) manually should tell which one. If you're using freeBSD 11 or greater, ports are available to meet all the necessary runtime dependencies.

If the necessary ports aren't already available on your system and you're using an older version of FreeBSD, I'd recommend looking here for ports:
