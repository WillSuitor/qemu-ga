1)Acquire the QGA .rpm with yumdownloader (sudo yumdownloader qemu-guest-agent).

2)Open the .rpm with rpmrebuild (rpmrebuild -ep qga_pkg_name.rpm)

3)Open a new terminal and navigate to the rebuild directory (cd ~/.tmp/rpmrebuild.*)

4)Modify the files in the work/root/ directory as follows:
	A)Change all instances of "org.qemu.guest_agent.0" to "org.qemu.guest_agent.1". These should appear in these two files: usr/lib/systemd/system/qemu-guest-agent.service and usr/lib/udev/rules.d/99-qemu-guest-agent.rules
	B)Swap out the qemu-ga binary in usr/bin for the new version.
	C)Remove all the entries from the BLACKLIST in etc/sysconfig/qemu-ga (i.e. set to BLACKLIST=)

5)Close the terminal used to edit files in the .tmp directory.

6)Modify the file open in the original terminal as follows: Underneath the line "%post -p /bin/sh", add two lines.
	A) chcon -t bin_t /usr/bin/qemu-ga
	B) mkdir /var/local/run/
	C) systemctl start qemu-guest-agent

7)Save your changes and enter Y when prompted. The resulting RPM should be placed in ~/rpmbuild/RPMS/Your_Architecture/qga.rpm.

8)Then, to create the .deb, simply copy the created .rpm file to an Ubuntu machine and run "alien qga.rpm".
