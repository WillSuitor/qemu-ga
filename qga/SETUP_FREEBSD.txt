In target FreeBSD VM

1)transfer the tar file to the target VM and unzip.

2)run the install_qga script as root.

3)reboot the VM and verify the service "qemu_guest_agent" is running.

4)If it's not, run the /usr/local/bin/qemu-ga command manually and it should
tell you what runtime dependency is failing (most likey glib). If you're using
FreeBSD 11 or greater, you will be able to install all the necessary runtime dependencies from ports.

In builder VM

1)You're gonna have to install some ports: 
	-gcc8-devel (configure will report gcc 7 works, it doesn't)
	-python36
	-git
  These three should install the other ones that are needed but if the next step reports missing dependencies,
  you'll have to install those from ports as well. Also, keep in mind that this takes a while. 

2)From the qemu-ga base dir, run "mkdir build && cp qga/configure_freeBSD build/configure_freeBSD"

3)"cd build && ./configure_freeBSD"

4)gmake
