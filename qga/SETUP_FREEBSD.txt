In target FreeBSD VM

1)add virtio_console_load="YES" to /boot/loader.conf and restart

In builder VM

1)You're gonna have to install some ports: 
	-gcc8-devel (configure will report gcc 7 works, it doesn't)
	-python36
	-git
  These three should install the other ones that are needed but if the next step reports missing dependencies,
  you'll have to install those from ports as well. Also, keep in mind that this takes a while. 

2)From the qemu-ga base dir, run "mkdir build && cp qga/configure_freeBSD build/configure_freeBSD"

3)"cd build && ./configure_freeBSD"

4)gmake
